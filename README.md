# Bifurcation-and-Lyapunov-Plots-GUI
This gui  developed by the code used in my bachelor thesis . You can choose between plenty of dynamical maps , and then you can plot with the parameters you given the Bifurcation Diagram and the Lyapunov Exponent.

When you open the executable file you will see the maps you can choose and two buttons.

The first button is the exit button, and the second one is the HELP button. I strongly advise you to read the HELP first, before you work with the map you want.

When you choose the map , it will open a new window where you have to enter some variables/values. After that you will choose which plots you want to show you by pressing one of the three buttons.
You can choose to plot the Bifurcation Diagram, the Lyapunov Expotent , and both of them in one plot.

Also if you want to run the r parameter over 500k times i recommend to run separately the plots through the python files(Bifurcation Diagram, and Lyapunov expotent). If you run the gui with a step 0.000001 which is one million steps!! it will freeze, because the gui doesnt optimize correctly the ram so it will occupy your entire ram and cpu. I run my gui in Ubuntu and in Windows too , with 16gb ram and 5900HS cpu. With these specs it freezes my pc with one million steps.

For bugs open an issue.
