# Bifurcation-and-Lyapunov-Plots-GUI
This gui  developed by the code used in my bachelor thesis . You can choose between plenty of dynamical maps , and then you can plot with the parameters you given the Bifurcation Diagram and the Lyapunov Exponent

When you open the executable file you will see the maps you can choose and two buttons.

The first button is the exit button, and the second one is the HELP button. I strongly advise you to read the HELP first, before you work with the map you want.

When you choose the map , it will open a new window where you have to enter some variables/values. After that you will choose which plots you want to show you by pressing one of the three buttons.
You can choose to plot the Bifurcation Diagram, the Lyapunov Expotent , and both of them in one plot.

For bugs open an issue.

For further questions contact with me.
